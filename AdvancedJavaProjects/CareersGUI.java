//this code is a simple implementation of a GUI application that allows users to select a career and view its details.
// It uses Java Swing to create a user interface with dropdowns, text fields, and labels.
// The application displays information about various engineering careers, including job title, field, company, education, salary, hours, certification/experience, responsibilities, and associated universities and colleges.
// The user can select a job from a dropdown menu, and the corresponding details will be displayed in the text fields.
// The application is designed to be user-friendly and informative, providing a quick overview of different career options in the engineering field.
